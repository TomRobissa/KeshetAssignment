# ðŸ“Œ Low-Scale, Fast Development System

## **ðŸ›  Technology Choices & Justification**

### **Frontend: Angular 2**
âœ… **Why?**
- Angular provides a **structured, component-based architecture**.
- Built-in **TypeScript support** improves maintainability.
- Includes **dependency injection and RxJS** for real-time data handling.

### **Backend: Nest.js**
âœ… **Why?**
- A **scalable and modular framework** built on TypeScript.
- Uses **Dependency Injection** for maintainability.
- Built-in support for **WebSockets**.
- Opinionated framework that establishes a standard in development teams.

### **Database: PostgreSQL** (Persistent Storage)
âœ… **Why?**
- **Relational Database** â†’ Structured invoice data fits well in SQL.
- Supports **JSON fields** (useful for semi-structured invoice metadata).

### **Priority ERP Integration**
- Introduce an extra API layer only if required to enable faster development.
- **Direct API calls** simplify the architecture. Scale to message queues if required.

### **WebSockets for Real-Time Updates**
âœ… **Why WebSockets instead of SSE (server-only updates) or Polling?**
1. **Low Latency:** WebSockets **establish a persistent connection**, reducing request overhead.
2. **Bi-Directional Communication:** WebSockets allow two-way communication. 
3. **Better Performance:** Polling creates **unnecessary load** by making frequent requests. WebSockets **only send data when needed**.
4. **Real time updates** - WebSockets can broadcast updates to all subscribers when a receipt is updated.

### **Additional Considerations**
- **Interchangable Communication:** If we were to switch to other ERPs, we should only replace the matching service.
  (either an API or a service in the back-end)
- **Error Handling & Retries:** Implement **exponential backoff** for failed ERP API calls.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Use **Elastic Stack (ELK)** for observability. 
- **Containerization:** use Docker To unlock reliable deployment across platforms. 
- **Cloud Providers:** use major cloud providers to relieve server maintenance and ensure smoother deployment. 
- **Optional Upscale:** As the system scales, We can duplicate nodes to handle an increasing number of users. 
  That could include duplicating the front-end, back-end or APIs. 
  As the system scales, we can introduce Kuberenetes to manage containers and monitor containers' health.
- **Load Balancing:** As the system scales, use Nginx to distribute load across multiple nodes. 
- **Message Queues:** As the system scales, use RabbitMQ to manage load on the APIs. 


## **ðŸŒŸ Summary**
First architectures is designed for **fast development** and **low-scale usage** with:
âœ… Direct Priority ERP API calls.
âœ… PostgreSQL for persistence.
âœ… WebSockets for real-time updates.
âœ… A simple yet scalable Nest.js backend.

Second architectures is designed for a **robust system** of many concurrent users with:
âœ… Separate APIs to communicate with Priority ERP.
âœ… Kuberenetes and Docker to manage containers.
âœ… RabbitMQ to manage load.
âœ… Nginx to distribute requests across nodes. 
âœ… Multiple nodes of each application, to support increasing number of users.
